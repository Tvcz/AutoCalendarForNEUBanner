### Installing from Source

Alternatively, If you want to install from the source code directly, do the following:
1) Download this repository (there should be a button near the top of the page).
2) Extract the zipped file to a folder.
3) Open Google Chrome, go to chrome://extensions/, and enable Developer Mode in the top right-hand corner.
4) Press "Load unpacked" and then navigate to the directory where you extracted the source code and select the folder that contains the "manifest.json" file in its root directory.
5) Chrome will load the extension and you should be good to go!

Note: Most people need not install from source, however if you want to be absolutely sure there are no security risks for you data, or you just want the latest versions before they are released to Chrome, then it may be for you. **Make sure you always read code before you run it!**
